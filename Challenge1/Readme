1 - There is one EC2 instance deployed per Availability Zone
2 - Refresh the website several times, note that the EC2 instance and Availability Zone change from among the three available
3 - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is used here. An Application Load Balancer receives each request and distributes it among the available EC2 server instances across Availability Zones.
    The requests are stateless, and therefore can be routed to any of the available EC2 instances
4 - The EC2 instances are in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group . This Auto Scaling Group was configured to maintain three instances, therefore if one instance is detected as unhealthy it will be replaced to maintain three healthy instances.
    AWS Auto Scaling can also be configured to scale up/down dynamically in response to workload consitions such as CPU utilization or request count.
